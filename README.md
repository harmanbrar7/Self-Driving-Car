100% JavaScript framework, with no libraries. 

The neural network is on the right side. The yellow indicators correspond to turning left, right, moving up and down.

Each part of the project is describing in corresponding js files.

Demo image and video is also provided. 

The car has 100 test cars "underneath it" acting as the brain. It learns from it's mistakes. Any car that hits the traffic or the road boundary, gets a "Damaged" attribute and turns grey. You will see the brain follow along the car that took the best path.

Code ran and tested on VSCode, use the Live Server extension see the model. Can alternatively use Settings > More tools > Developer Tools on Google Chrome. 

There is a save and erase button to save your best run and the model improves upon itself.

Can add as many traffic cars as you want. The code is fully responsive.
